### Hi there, I'm Hope 👋🏾
- 🔭 I've spent most of my professional life in multimedia production before expanding into tech as a full-stack software developer. 

- 📚💻 I'm a virtual coding instructor specializing in project-based web development and cloud fundamentals for organizations and programs such as Beam Institute of Technology, Pluralsight, Code First Girls, Coding Black Females, Frauenloop and ReDI School of Digital Integration.

- ⚛️ I'm really passionate about digital literacy and actively involved in communities such as Google's Women Techmakers and the very much missed Women Who Code.

- I served as the 2023/24 Women Who Code Cloud Leadership Fellow. Through this fellowship I was responsible for curating cloud technology-focused panels, workshops, lightning talks, career development opportunities, and resources to connect and empower the WWCode global community of over three hundred thousand members in 147 countries.

- 📝✍🏾 I occasionally write technical articles targeting beginner developers on platforms such as Educative.io and the Women Who Code blog. (samples: https://www.educative.io/answers/what-are-break-continue-and-pass-statements-in-python and https://www.womenwhocode.com/blog/exciting-new-features-in-google-s-material-design-google-i-o-keynote-2023)

- 🤓🎨 I’m currently working on a full-stack web application personal project that incorporates tech into my artistic explorations.

- 🌍 I'm an aspiring polyglot and find learning languages to be a lovely metaphor for learning programming. Aside from English, I speak Yoruba, German, and basic French. I'm continually humbled by the Arabic alphabet but determined to get there! Advice or tips are certainly welcome 🥲.

- ⚡🐔🥚 Fun fact: Whilst growing up, my family sold eggs and chickens and I developed quite a strong aversion to both. I particularly despise the smell of fried eggs🍳🤢.
