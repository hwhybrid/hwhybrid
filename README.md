### Hi there, I'm Hope 👋🏾
- 🔭 I've spent most of my professional life in multimedia production before expanding into tech as a full-stack software developer. 

- 📚💻 I love teaching and work as a lead instructor at Code First Girls teaching project-based Javascript, Python, and full-stack web development to virtual cohorts of up to 30 students.

- ⚛️ I'm really passionate about digital literacy and actively involved in organizations such as Women Who Code (Front End, Python, Berlin, and New York networks), Google's Tech Equity Collective, Coding Black Females, and the AWS All Builders Welcome community. 

- 📝✍🏾 I write technical articles targeting beginner developers on platforms such as Educative.io and the Women Who Code blog. (sample: https://www.educative.io/answers/what-are-break-continue-and-pass-statements-in-python and https://www.womenwhocode.com/blog/exciting-new-features-in-google-s-material-design-google-i-o-keynote-2023)

- 🤓🎨 I’m currently working on a full-stack web application that incorporates tech into my artistic explorations.

- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on fun, creative, and challenging projects.

- 🌍 I'm an aspiring polyglot and find learning languages to be a lovely metaphor for learning programming. Aside from English, I speak Yoruba, German, and basic French. I'm continually humbled by the Arabic alphabet but determined to get there! Advice or tips are certainly welcome 🥲.

- ⚡🐔🥚 Fun fact: Whilst growing up, my family sold eggs and chickens and I developed quite a strong aversion to both. I particularly despise the smell of fried eggs🍳🤢.
